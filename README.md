Image Classification: Detecting Presence of Sea

I built this project to classify images based on whether they contain the sea or not. The goal was to train a traditional machine learning model that could distinguish between images with sea and those without using custom handcrafted features.

The function raw_image_to_representation extracts several types of image representations, such as color histograms (HC), grayscale pixels (GC), raw pixel tensors (PX), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and hybrid combinations like HOG + HC. These representations are used to build structured datasets through load_transform_label_train_dataset and load_transform_test_data, where each image is labeled as either "sea" or "non-sea" based on its folder or name.

The model training happens in learn_model_from_dataset, where I integrated support for Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, Naive Bayes, k-NN, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and ensemble techniques like Voting and Stacking. Grid search and cross-validation are used for hyperparameter tuning.

This project is a practical exploration of classical ML techniques applied to image classification, focusing on the specific and interpretable task of sea detection without relying on deep learning. Itâ€™s flexible, modular, and designed for experimentation.
